# Potential Buffer Overflow in Assembly Code

This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a short assembly code snippet.  The code attempts to add 10 to a value in memory. However, it lacks boundary checks, leading to potential buffer overflow if the memory location pointed to by EBX is insufficient to store the result. The solution demonstrates how to address this vulnerability with proper boundary checks. 

## Vulnerability

The core issue lies within the `add eax, 10` instruction. If the value at `[ebx+4]` plus 10 exceeds the available space at the memory location pointed to by `ebx`, a buffer overflow will occur. This could lead to unpredictable program behavior or even crashes.

## Solution

The solution presented includes boundary checks before performing the addition operation. The code now ensures sufficient memory is available before modifying the target memory location. This approach significantly reduces the risk of a buffer overflow.
